# SAREFized OPSD household graphs

This repository contains multiple graphs containing measurements from the [OPSD household dataset](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/household_data/2020-04-15).

The [SAREF ontology](https://saref.etsi.org/) was used to create the knowledge graphs. 

1res_1dev: all measurements from one device in one house.
1res_Adev: all measurements from all devices in one house.
Ares_Adev: all measurements from all devices from all houses.

graphs_opsd contain measurements from at most 37 devices over a ten month period.

Graphs_1000 contain all measurements from the 1000 warmest and 1000 coldest outside temperature timepoints (based on weatherdata not included in the graph) over the 10 month timeframe.
